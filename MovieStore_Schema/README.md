# Movie Store Rental Database
A movie rental database schema created using the Oracle SQL Developer IDE and Data Definition Language (DDL) SQL commands. 
Data Manipulation Language (DML) SQL commands were subsequently used to populate and alter the database. 
Entity and referential integrity were enforced through the use of appropriate primary and foreign keys. 
The schema was initially designed in an Entity/Relationship Diagram using the ER-Assistant application.
